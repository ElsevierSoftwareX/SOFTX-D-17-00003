<p>This operation removes tuples with unknown compounds from the sequence.
<p>Unknown compounds are displayed as <span style="background-color:#B0B0B0">UNK</span> in the compound display. For codons (tuples of length three), unknown compounds are those not coding an amino acid. For tessera (tuples of length four), nonsense tuples are removed.
<p><b>Example:</b><table class="example">
	<tr><td>Input sequence:</td><td>ACA AAX XCU UAU GAG</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Output sequence:</td><td>ACA UAU GAG</td></tr>
