<p>BDA Tool is a build in tool of the Genetic Code Analysis Toolkit to create and modify Binary Dichotomic Algorithms as described by Gumbel, Fimmel, Danielli and Str&uuml;ngmann in BioSystems 128 (2015).
<p>A BDA-generated model is based on binary dichotomic algorithms (BDAs). Such a BDA partitions the set of 64 codons into two disjoint classes of size 32 each and provides a generalization of known partitions like the Rumer dichotomy.
<p>Start the BDA tool by pressing the <img src="bda.png"> in the Analysis Tool. A BDA can be load and saved using the buttons in the toolbar of the BDA tool. Edit the BDA by using the items next to the display of the BDA. While changing the BDA the class table shows the partitioning performed by the BDA.
