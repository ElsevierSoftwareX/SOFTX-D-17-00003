<p>The Genetic Code Analysis Toolkit (GCAT) features a comprehensive editor to edit and analyze genetic code sequences and sets.
<p>The user interface (UI) is separated into five areas with different purpose:
<ul>
	<li>The <b>input area</b> on the left side can be used to quickly add codons to the editor.</li>
	<li>
		Underneath the input area, you'll find all available <b>operations</b>. Operations are separated into different categories:
		<ul>
			<li><i>Test:</i> Tests a genetic sequence for a specific question and returns a boolean result.</li>
			<li><i>Transformation:</i> Transforms a given genetic sequence into another sequence based on certain rules.</li>
			<li><i>Split:</i> Splits a sequence into one or more sub-sequences.</li>
			<li><i>Analysis:</i> Performs an arbitrary analysis on a genetic sequence.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The <b>editor</b> is the input area of the tool. By typing you can add nucleotides to the editor.</li>
	<li>On the right side of the editor is the <b>display area</b>. Different kinds of displays feature a graphical view on the sequence or provide additional information.</li>
	<li>Below the editor is the <b>output area</b>, which displays the result of tests, analysis or other operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of the tool, you will find access to all operations in the menu- and toolbar.
<h2>Open / Import File</h2>
<p>The Toolkit features an own file format (.gen) to store and load files containing genetic code sequences. Using the import functionality you can open FATSA files (.fasta) or import genetic sequences from GenBank.
