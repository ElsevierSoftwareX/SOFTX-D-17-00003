<p>The &quot;<b>Split</b>&quot; functionality allows you to split a given sequence at a certain delimiter.
<p>The delimiter specifies where the sequence should be split. The delimiter is located using the <a href="help:///3. Operations/3.1. General/Find"><b>Find</b></a> functionality. Afterwards the sequence is split at the found delimiter positions and the result is displayed.
<p>Splitting a sequence &quot;AGU ACA AGG&quot; with the delimiter &quot;ACA&quot; will result in two sequences: &quot;AGU ACA&quot; and &quot;AGG&quot;. Choosing &quot;<b>Remove delimiter</b>&quot; will remove the delimiter on the split, so the result of the previous example would be &quot;AGU&quot; and &quot;AGG&quot;. 
<p><b>Example: Split at &quot;UGC&quot;</b><table class="example">
	<tr><td>Input sequence:</td><td>CAC UGC CAG UGC AUA UGC</td></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan="7">Output sequences:</td><td>UGC</td></tr>
	<tr><td>CAC UGC</td></tr>
	<tr><td>CAG UGC</td></tr>
	<tr><td>AUA UGC</td></tr>
