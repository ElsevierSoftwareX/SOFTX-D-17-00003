<p>The &quot;<b>Find</b>&quot; functionallity can be used to search for certain patterns in a sequence.
<p>The search is always performed from top to bottom, starting from the current position of the cursor in the sequence. The option &quot;<b>Wrap Search</b>&quot; can be used to begin searching from the start of the sequence if the end was reached before a matching string was found. As soon as a match was found the sequence will be selected and marked in the editor.
<p>By default the search input does only allow single nucliotide bases. For a more complex search, regular expressions can be used by enabeling the &quot;<b>Regular Expression</b>&quot; checkbox. Any combination of the constructs listed in the following table can be used to search for a given pattern.

<p>To match e.g. all codons (tuples of length 3) ending in U, the regular expression <b>??U</b> may be used. For tessera (tuples of length 4) starting with U and ending either in A or C the regular expression <b>U??(A|C)</b> applies.
